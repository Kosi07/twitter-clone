## ToDo
I really just want to nail Twitter's frontend design.

- [ ] User can select emojis from an emoji selector.


Responsiveness
- [x]Clicking an image makes the image go full screen.
- Clicking on a tweet makes the tweet go full screen. Comments appear down below

- Darkmode/Lightmode toggle.

- [x] NavBar icons should be highlighted depending on what icon you click

- [x] User should be able to add images to tweets

- [x] User should be able to like tweets.


- [x] Auth
- [x] Finish OAuth setup with X and Google

-[]Modified readme, removed Github OAuth, removed AuthJS, minor styling changes, added better-auth and mongodb and now render tweets from DB

-[ ] Limit DB fetch calls to 7 tweets at a time
- [ ] Infinite scroll?

- [ ] How do I send them a Welcome Email?

- [ ] User should be able to change profile picture, name and handle. This should reflect in the mongoDB.
- [ ] Store Tweets and messages in DB.
- [ ] User should be able to message other users.
