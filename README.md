## ToDo
I really just want to nail Twitter's core functionalities.

Core Functionality
- [x] User can select emojis from an emoji selector.

- [ ] Use user's name to generate handle for him which he can modify with "Edit Profile" button

- [ ] Querying DB every 15 secs for new Tweets, then render <div onClick={ ()=> setTweetsArray( prev => [...newTweets, ...prev]) }>Show {n} new tweets</div>

- [ ] Infinite scroll?

- [ ] User should be able to message other users.

Design
- Darkmode/Lightmode toggle.

Interactiveness

Responsiveness

Engagement
- [ ] How do I send them a Welcome Email? and email notifications
